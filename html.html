            <h2>My Poetry</h2>
            <p>These are some of my poems:</p>

            <h3>Embers of the Night</h3>
            <p>In the quiet embrace of the night,<br>
            where shadows stretch and whisper secrets,<br>
            I choose to linger, a steadfast presence,<br>
            a gentle anchor amid the tides of solitude.<br>
            Here, the hours weave themselves into a tapestry,<br>
            each thread a moment, a memory, a fleeting thought,<br>
            unraveling in the soft glow of the moonlight,<br>
            as if the universe itself breathes in sync with my heart.</p>

            <p>The night is long, yes,<br>
            a canvas vast and unyielding,<br>
            painted with the hues of longing and dreams,<br>
            where silence speaks in riddles,<br>
            and the stars, like distant candles,<br>
            flicker with the wisdom of ages.<br>
            They remind us that even in darkness,<br>
            there exists a beauty that transcends the veil,<br>
            a light that dances just beyond our reach.</p>

            <p>May you have a good dream,<br>
            for dreams are the whispers of our souls,<br>
            the uncharted territories of our desires.<br>
            They beckon us to wander,<br>
            to explore the landscapes of our mind,<br>
            where the impossible becomes possible,<br>
            and the mundane transforms into the extraordinary.<br>
            In dreams, we find the courage to face our fears,<br>
            to unearth the treasures buried deep within,<br>
            for it is in the realm of dreams<br>
            that we can truly be free.</p>

            <p>And a fire,<br>
            that primal flicker of warmth and light,<br>
            the heart of the home,<br>
            where stories are shared and laughter echoes.<br>
            It crackles with life,<br>
            each spark a reminder of our shared humanity,<br>
            igniting the bonds that tie us together.<br>
            In its glow, we find solace,<br>
            a refuge from the world's chaos,<br>
            a place where the burdens of the day dissipate,<br>
            and we can simply be, together.</p>

            <p>And a light,<br>
            not just the illumination that chases away the dark,<br>
            but a beacon of hope,<br>
            a guiding force through the labyrinth of existence.<br>
            It teaches us that even the smallest flicker<br>
            can pierce the depths of despair,<br>
            that in our darkest hours,<br>
            we can find the strength to rise,<br>
            to seek the dawn that awaits beyond the horizon.</p>

            <p>And a home,<br>
            not merely the walls that shelter us,<br>
            but the essence of belonging,<br>
            the sanctuary of our hearts.<br>
            It is where love resides,<br>
            where memories are etched into the fabric of time,<br>
            where we gather to celebrate our triumphs and heal our wounds.<br>
            Home is the laughter of children,<br>
            the shared meals, the quiet moments,<br>
            the safe harbor in the storms of life.</p>

            <p>So as the night stretches on,<br>
            and the world outside fades into a hushed lullaby,<br>
            I remain with you,<br>
            a witness to your journey,<br>
            a companion in the dance of existence.<br>
            Together, we will navigate the shadows,<br>
            embrace the dreams,<br>
            foster the fire,<br>
            nurture the light,<br>
            and build a home within the depths of our souls.<br>
            For in this long night,<br>
            we find not just our place,<br>
            but the essence of what it means to be alive.<br>
            Together, we weave a narrative of hope,<br>
            a philosophy of love,<br>
            and a promise that even in the longest of nights,<br>
            we shall always find our way back to each other.<br>
            Khaya.✨❤</p>

            <h3>Collateral Damage</h3>
            <p>In the quiet corners of our shared moments,<br>
            where laughter dances with whispers,<br>
            there lies a tapestry woven with threads<br>
            of joy and sorrow,<br>
            the bittersweet symphony of us.</p>

            <p>There’s always collateral damage,<br>
            the remnants of our fierce love,<br>
            like shattered glass glinting in the sun,<br>
            each piece reflecting a memory,<br>
            a laugh, a tear, a promise made and broken.</p>

            <p>We stand in our Paris,<br>
            not a city of lights,<br>
            but a realm carved from our dreams,<br>
            where love blooms amidst the chaos,<br>
            and every heartbeat echoes the struggle,<br>
            the fight to keep us whole.</p>

            <p>Hand in hand, we navigate the ruins,<br>
            the remnants of battles fought in silence,<br>
            where words sometimes falter,<br>
            and misunderstandings linger like shadows,<br>
            but still, we rise,<br>
            forging our path through the wreckage.</p>

            <p>Each scar tells a story,<br>
            a testament to love’s resilience,<br>
            the way we find the beauty<br>
            in the imperfect,<br>
            in the moments that could have torn us apart,<br>
            yet bind us closer, like vines entwined.</p>

            <p>Your smile, a lighthouse,<br>
            guides me through the stormy seas,<br>
            your laughter, a melody,<br>
            that soothes the raw edges of my heart.<br>
            In the heart of our Paris,<br>
            I see the love that transcends the pain,<br>
            a tapestry rich with color,<br>
            woven from threads of compassion,<br>
            forgiveness, and understanding.</p>

            <p>Together, we dance through the debris,<br>
            creating our own rhythm,<br>
            finding solace in every glance,<br>
            every touch, every whispered promise.<br>
            In this beautiful chaos,<br>
            we sculpt our love anew,<br>
            each day a canvas,<br>
            each moment, a brushstroke.</p>

            <p>So let us embrace the collateral damage,<br>
            the scars that mark our journey,<br>
            for they are the proof of a love<br>
            that dared to be real,<br>
            that fought to withstand the storms.<br>
            In this Paris of ours,<br>
            I choose you,<br>
            over and over,<br>
            in every life,<br>
            in every world,<br>
            because with you,<br>
            I have found my home.</p>

            <p>And though the road may twist and turn,<br>
            I know that hand in hand,<br>
            we will navigate the ruins,<br>
            and in the end,<br>
            we will emerge,<br>
            not unscathed,<br>
            but beautifully whole,<br>
            two souls entwined,<br>
            forever bound in love.</p>

            <h3>A Weight We Carry</h3>
            <p>In the everyday moments,<br>
            in the chaos of morning routines,<br>
            I see you, staring into the coffee cup,<br>
            the steam rising like our unspoken thoughts,<br>
            and I wonder—<br>
            can you taste the heaviness that lingers,<br>
            or is it just me,<br>
            always feeling the weight?</p>

            <p>At least one of us is happy,<br>
            you say, but it hangs in the air,<br>
            a question wrapped in doubt,<br>
            while I stand here, trying to be the anchor,<br>
            to hold it all together,<br>
            even when it feels like I’m fraying at the edges.</p>

            <p>Your laughter feels distant,<br>
            a faint echo of what it used to be,<br>
            and I can’t help but notice<br>
            the way your eyes gloss over,<br>
            lost somewhere between obligation and despair.<br>
            You carry your sadness like a coat,<br>
            wearing it even in the warmth of our home.</p>

            <p>But if it must be this way,<br>
            if one of us has to bear the burden,<br>
            I’d rather it be me—<br>
            so you don’t have to struggle alone.<br>
            I’ll take the weight of the world on my shoulders,<br>
            the quiet battles that no one else sees,<br>
            while you find a moment to breathe,<br>
            to reclaim the pieces of yourself.</p>

            <p>I’ll sift through the remnants of our days,<br>
            gathering the fragments of dreams<br>
            that slipped through our fingers,<br>
            and I’ll wear the disappointment like armor,<br>
            so you can step forward,<br>
            even if just for a moment,<br>
            without the fear of falling.</p>

            <p>In the silence of our shared space,<br>
            I promise to carry the grief,<br>
            to shoulder the unfulfilled expectations,<br>
            so you can find solace in the mundane,<br>
            in the simple act of living,<br>
            without the weight of “what if”<br>
            pressing down on your chest.</p>

            <p>I’m here, standing firm,<br>
            a wall against the storms that rage,<br>
            taking on the shadows that dance between us,<br>
            the moments that feel too heavy,<br>
            and I’ll keep doing it,<br>
            again and again,<br>
            because I can’t bear to see you fade.</p>

            <p>Let me be the one who navigates the mess,<br>
            who sorts through the clutter of our lives,<br>
            while you find a way to smile,<br>
            even if it’s just for a fleeting second,<br>
            because deep down, I know<br>
            that happiness can be a flicker,<br>
            and I’ll hold onto it for both of us.</p>

            <p>So take your time,<br>
            let the sadness rest in my hands,<br>
            let me carry the burdens<br>
            that weigh us down,<br>
            until the day we can stand side by side,<br>
            not defined by what we’ve lost,<br>
            but by the strength we’ve found<br>
            in each other,<br>
            in this imperfect life we lead.</p>

            <h3>My World</h3>
            <p>In the quiet moments, where silence breathes life,<br>
            I find my truth woven in the tapestry of your being,<br>
            The world, a distant echo, fades into obscurity,<br>
            As I stand before you, heart bared,<br>
            Exposed like a fragile bloom in the dawn's soft embrace.</p>

            <p>Your laughter, a melody that dances through my veins,<br>
            Each note a promise, a whisper of forever,<br>
            And in those shared silences, where time holds its breath,<br>
            I glimpse the universe—<br>
            Not in stars or galaxies, but in the depths of your eyes,<br>
            The cosmos unfolds in the warmth of your gaze.</p>

            <p>You are the sun that breaks the dawn,<br>
            Chasing away shadows that linger in the corners of my soul,<br>
            In your presence, I am reborn,<br>
            A sculptor carving dreams from the clay of our moments,<br>
            Each word, each touch, a brushstroke on the canvas of our lives.</p>

            <p>The world outside may swirl in chaos,<br>
            With its clamor and rush, its laughter and tears,<br>
            But here, wrapped in the cocoon of your love,<br>
            I am anchored,<br>
            A ship docked in the harbor of your heart,<br>
            Safe from the storms that rage beyond.</p>

            <p>I see a future painted in shades of us,<br>
            A life where love is the foundation,<br>
            Each day a brick laid with intention,<br>
            The walls adorned with memories, laughter, and dreams,<br>
            Where the mundane becomes sacred,<br>
            And the ordinary transforms into extraordinary.</p>

            <p>What is the world without you?<br>
            A barren landscape, a melody without harmony,<br>
            I would trade the sun’s light for the glow of your smile,<br>
            For in your presence, I find the warmth of a thousand suns,<br>
            A universe where love is the only reality,<br>
            And every heartbeat echoes your name.</p>

            <p>So let us wander through the chapters yet unwritten,<br>
            Hand in hand, two souls intertwined,<br>
            With each step, we’ll carve our legacy,<br>
            A testament to love’s power, its grace,<br>
            And in the quiet of our shared dreams,<br>
            I will whisper, “You are my everything.”</p>

            <p>Together we’ll write our story,<br>
            With ink made of stardust and hope,<br>
            A tale where every dawn is a new beginning,<br>
            Every dusk a reminder of our journey,<br>
            And in the tapestry of time,<br>
            You will be the thread that binds my heart,<br>
            The compass guiding me home.</p>

            <p>For in this vast world,<br>
            Where everything seems fleeting,<br>
            You are my eternity,<br>
            The singular truth that grounds me,<br>
            And as I stand here,<br>
            With love spilling from my lips,<br>
            I declare—<br>
            The world does not exist for me beyond you.</p>
